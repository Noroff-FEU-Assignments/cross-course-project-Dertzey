    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">There are several ways a client can secure his/her website from web security attacks. An important thing would be to add a security socket layer (SSL) which is a protocol that will allow user to send secure communication over their computer network and ensure that nobody else will tap into the content. 

    Clients are also adviced to invest in a website vulnerability scanners that will be able to identify technical weaknesses on the website, including weaknesses that will be vurnerable to SQL injection and XSS attacks among many others.
